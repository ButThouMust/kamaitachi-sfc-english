# Spoiler details for translation
This page will discuss aspects of the script that will spoil certain parts of the game. Geared mainly towards people who have played the Rinne Saisei remake in English, or have played other versions of the game in Japanese (e.g. SFC, PS1, GBA, 2024 PC remake).

## Japanese comedians
Some choices at dinner lead you to a path with some references to famous Japanese comedians. According to some videos, the Rinne Saisei translation replaces them with references to Robin Williams.

## Peashooters...?
Shortly before the first opportunity to point out the killer's identity, there is this piece of dialogue between Mari and Tooru. Is my translation correct...?

「60>どうしたの？　鳩が水鉄砲食らったみたいな顔して」\
"What's the matter? You look really surprised, like a dove that got hit by a water gun."\
「それを言うなら豆鉄砲だろ」\
"If you say so, then was it a peashooter?"

## The Night of the Kamai-tachi
One route you unlock after solving the murder mystery has Tooru finding a Super Famicom (or a PS1, in all subsequent rereleases) in the ski lodge's lounge. Without giving too much away, it turns into a joke situation where everyone finds out that near everyone has a surname pronounced Kamai (but with different spellings).

The joke is that in Japanese, you can say that かまいたち refers to multiple people named Kamai (kamai-tachi) as opposed to the yokai kamaitachi (kama-itachi). The Rinne Saisei translation localized the joke about everyone instead starting up a session of Kamaita**i**chi.

## Okama-ita-chi
One part of the game that aged poorly to me regards a route you unlock once you get the pink bookmark. One character is an okama, which is a Japanese word for an effeminate man who dresses like a woman. The relevant text needs to be translated, *carefully*, to say the least.

## Subliminal messages
One pink bookmark route is about the cast finding a cryptic hint about treasure being in the lodge. It turns out that the solution lies in a subliminal message that you can spot if you read the text in a certain way.

I was insatiably curious about how the Rinne Saisei translation handled this, and must say that they translated it much better than anything I could have ever come up with myself. It is not only accurate but preserves the subliminal message.

If this wasn't enough, Chunsoft put in *even more* subliminal messages after that, for the player to try to spot. It has directions to do, *something* that I don't want to give away here. Not the fault of Project Kamai, but the directions in the SFC version are much cooler than what's in Rinne Saisei (regardless of whether you play in Japanese or English).
