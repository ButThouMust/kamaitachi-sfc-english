# Spoiler details for translation
This page will discuss aspects of the script that will be either spoilers for certain parts of the game, or translation sore spots. Geared mainly towards people who have played the Rinne Saisei remake in English, or have played other versions of the game in Japanese (e.g. SFC, PS1, GBA, 2024 PC remake).

## Mari mistaken for an actress
Early in the game, one choice has Aki mistake Mari for an actress in a skiing film. According to a Japanese blog post, the names of both the actress and the film are similar to a real film from 1987. I'm not 100% sure about the translations for the names in the game. ([Source](http://nohohonbaracha.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-43.html))

In game:
- 原田<ins>桃</ins>世, Momoyo Harada
- 『私もたまには連れてって』, "Come With Me Sometimes"

Actual movie:
- 原田<ins>知</ins>世, Tomoyo Harada
- 『私をスキーに連れてって』, "Come Skiing With Me"

## Baka vaca
One path you can take for dinner leads to a pun that depends on both Japanese and Spanish, interestingly. Tooru can call Mari's uncle Mr. Kobayashi an idiot (馬鹿 *baka*) for quitting his job as a lawyer to start up the ski lodge, which she takes offense to. He manages to start smoothing things over by saying:
> 「ところでスペイン語で『バカ』って『牛』の意味って知ってた？」\
> More literal:
> - "By the way, did you know that 'baka' means cow in Spanish?"
> 
> Better explanation:
> - "By the way, did you know that the Japanese word for idiot, baka, sounds like the Spanish word for cow, vaca?"

One way I'd thought of to translate this was to have Tooru call him a moron instead, and try to explain it away with, "By the way, did you know that the word 'oxymoron' is itself an oxymoron, meaning 'sharp-dull' in Greek?"

## Japanese comedians and foie gras
Some choices at dinner lead you to a path with some references to famous Japanese comedians (谷啓 Kei Tani, ハナ肇 Hajime Hana, 植木等 Hitoshi Ueki) and/or a discussion of foie gras and culinary delicacies. According to some videos, the Rinne Saisei translation replaces the comedian references with references to Robin Williams.

## Ikkyuu-san
Tooru compares Kayama, hesitating when jokingly confronted about going to find the killer in the blizzard, to "Ikkyuu-san."
> まるで一休さんだ。\
> He's being like Ikkyuu-san.

The first result I found for it was a 1970s/1980s anime series based on the life of a real-life Zen Buddhist monk. Don't know a good way to translate the nuance behind this.

## Peashooters and water guns
Shortly before the first opportunity to point out the killer's identity, there is this piece of dialogue between Mari and Tooru.
> 「どうしたの？　鳩が水鉄砲食らったみたいな顔して」\
> "What's the matter? You look really surprised [like a dove that got hit by a water gun]."\
> 「それを言うなら豆鉄砲だろ」\
> "I thought the expression used a peashooter instead?"
> 「いいじゃないの、どっちでも。それで、一体どうしたのよ」
> “It's fine, it doesn't matter. Anyway, what is it?”

The Japanese expression usually uses 豆鉄砲 "peashooter" instead of 水鉄砲 "water gun" like what Mari said. I wonder if there's a good way to incorporate a joke here.

## The Night of the Kamai-tachi
One route you unlock after solving the murder mystery has Tooru finding a Super Famicom (or a PS1, in all subsequent rereleases) in the ski lodge's lounge. Without giving too much away, it turns into a joke situation where they all find out that near everyone has a surname pronounced Kamai (but with different spellings).

The joke is that in Japanese, you can say that かまいたち refers to multiple people named Kamai (鎌井達 *kamai-tachi* "Kamai and others") as opposed to the yokai kamaitachi (kama-itachi). The Rinne Saisei translation localized the joke with all the Kamais starting up a session of tai chi, so Kamai tai chi.

## Okama-ita-chi
One part of the game that aged poorly to me regards a route you unlock once you get the pink bookmark. One character is an okama, which is a Japanese word for an effeminate man who dresses like a woman. Clyde Mandelin has an [article](https://legendsoflocalization.com/articles/okama-in-game-translation/) about the word. The relevant text needs to be translated, *carefully*, to say the least. I plan to just leave the word as-is whenever it pops up.

There is also an untranslatable joke that connects the situation to the kamaitachi, hence the title of this section.

## Subliminal messages
One pink bookmark route is about the cast finding a cryptic hint about a treasure being in the lodge. It turns out that the solution lies in a subliminal message that you can spot if you read the text in a certain way.

I was insatiably curious about how the Rinne Saisei translation handled this, and must say that they translated it much better than anything I could have ever come up with myself. It is not only accurate but preserves the subliminal message.

I reused what the subliminal message turns out to be. My translation is not as flowery as what was in the Rinne Saisei translation, but it does fit the limitations of the SNES screen resolution with the font I'm using. Improvements and suggestions are welcome:

Original:\
> 宝はシュプールの中にある。\
> １と３の間、\
> 冥土へと向かう道の途中。\
> 負け犬は去れ。\
> 車井戸がきしるから、\
> あの泥棒がうらやましい。\
> あなたに似た人より早く、\
> たからのありかを探りだせ。

Translating each line more literally:\
> A treasure is in the Spur.\
> It is between 1 and 3,\
> on the road to the underworld.\
> Send the losers away. [unsure]\
> Because the well creaks,\
> it is jealous of that thief.\
> Faster than a person who looks like you,\
> seek out the treasure.\

Attempt to preserve hidden message:\
> Hark, a treasure is hidden in the spur.\
> Try checking from between 1 and 3, to\
> the underworld where all losers shall be.\
> The creaking well passionately envies\
> that kleptomaniac of a thief.\
> Seek out the treasure, before\
> the one who looks like you finds it.

Chunsoft also put in two more subliminal messages in the text after the answer is revealed, for the player to try to spot. They are directions to do something *wholly unique* to the SFC version that I don't want to give away here. I did figure out a way to translate the text while preserving the subliminal messages.

## Mysterious Fountain
One of the pink bookmark routes has a joke that is completely lost in translation to English in particular. It involves a sign that reads, in English, "Welcome to Mysterious Fountain." Mari and Tooru have this exchange about it:
> 「ファウンテンって確か英語で泉のことよね？」\
> "I'm sure 'fountain' is the English word for 泉, right?"\
> 「馬鹿だな真理。ファウンテンって言ったら山に決まってるじゃないか」\
> "No it's not, Mari. They're obviously talking about a 山."

Where the joke is that 泉 *izumi* means fountain and 山 *yama* means mountain.

## Otogirisou title screen

![](/repo%20images/otogirisou%20title%20screen%20recreation%20full.png)

No, I'm not making this up! This involves a joke route that you unlock after solving the murder mystery. In the lounge, Tooru and Mari find a Super Famicom with copies of Otogirisou and Kamaitachi no Yoru. If you pick Otogirisou, you will see a recreation of that game's title screen.

The graphics for the TV border are separate, but in normal play, you will only ever see the title screen recreation with the TV border.

I suppose you can argue that since the story says Super *Famicom* instead of Super *Nintendo*, you can get away with keeping in the original logo. I'd gotten permission from Muttvil, the user who created the translated title logo for my Otogirisou translation project, to reuse it for Kamaitachi no Yoru.

There's one thing that complicates inserting the translated logo. In the original game, the logo and the background image of the mansion and field of flowers are on separate background layers. The recreation in Kamaitachi combines them into one layer, and the colors between each version are not 100% the same.
